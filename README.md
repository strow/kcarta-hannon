Infrared Radiative Transfer Algorithm using kCompressed Look-Up Tables

This Matlab package is a version of the UMBC kCARTA F77 radiative transfer algorithm. It does not include analytic Jacobians or scattering, both of which are in the F77 code.

In order to run this code you will need to add the "Data" directory with the kCompressed coefficients.  They can be found at ftp://asl.umbc.edu/pub/Kcarta_data.  Download the directory Data and put that in the Kcarta directory.
